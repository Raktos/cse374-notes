MIDTERM REVIEW

don't need to memorize options for various commands.
won't need to memorize test options either

SHELL
basic shell operations
look at all commands from first lecture

familiar with redirection
>
>>
<
|

command substitution
$()

you can use backticks too but it's ugly as sin

man page documentation
materials will be in that format so you better know how to read it

if
for
while
reading files
processing
args

REGEX
how to sed
how to regex

C PROGRAMMING
ptrs
structs
memory model
       stack
       heap
malloc
free
calloc


HW4 STUFF

how to orgainze code for HW4, this may be useful...
extended example coding too so prolly go look a that later.

we gonna have a trie file
and a main file

main will handle the interactive session
it will construct the trie
it will prompt for new input

TRIE.C
struct node
function create
	 creates a trie by reading input parameter
function insert
	 inserts a new word
function lookup
	 looks up something
function destroy
	 deallocates all heap memory being used by this trie
lookup thing for character to number gonna be in here somewhere

TRIE.H
delcarations of all that crap
insert may only be used inside trie.c, it may be a "private" function, and thus NOT in trie.h
       or maybe it will be it depends (prolly not tho srsly)

MAIN.C
#include trie.h
should not need any structs or functions prolly.
gonna just be a single main method that does the shit it needs to do.


linkedlist in demo.c
