More C prolly idk.

variables are just a label in code to refer to data stored in memory. After compilation they cease to exist.

a ptr is a label for a bit of data in memory that refers to a different bit of data in memory. cool.

ASSIGNMENT:
left expression vs right
left value vs right
lvalue vs right

Things behave differently depending on the side they appear on
on the right we get value
on the left we assign to

a (assign to) = b (get value of b)

left evaluates to a location
right evaluates to the actual data

DANGER
dangerous and very bad practive to return ptrs to local variables
