arrays are ptrs to the first element of an array oh boy I know we did that last time.

OH MAN HW HELP TOOLS YEAH

CLint
Checks C Style in a file.
cool.

gdb
debugger magic shit
hunt down segmentation faults which give the wonderful error "there was a segmentation fault somwhere sometime probably"
see reference sheet


STRUCTS OH BOY

struct point {
       int x;
       int y;
};

struct point p;
p.x = 2;
p.y = 3;

CANNOT give default values to struct variables

struct point makePoint(int x, int y) {
       struct point p;
       p.x = x;
       p.y = y;

       return p;
}


EXERCISE OH BOY

struct string {
       int length;
       char *str;
};


we don't have to write "struct" all the time. using a special C construct called typedef OH MAN MAGIC SHIT.

Makes aliases for existing types

after defining point struct...

typedef struct point Point;

Point p; Just like a class. mostly. sort of. not really but whatev.

typedef struct point {
	int x;
	int y;
} Point;

WOO ALL IN ONE GO.

lowercase point up there can actually be omitted usually.
unless you want recursion. then you need the little lowercase bit.
