operations in C are more similar to what the computer is actually doing, rather than abstracted
"low level" language

we end up doing more ourselves. Memory management etc.

procedural language
no objects or classes etc. the ususal
all computation happens inside functions
basic unit is not a class, it is a function

data types
integer
	int (4byte)
	char (1byte)
	short int (2bytes)
	long int (8bytes)
	signed/unsigned

floating point
	 float (4bytes)
	 double (8byes)
	 long double (16bytes)

arrays
	magic
	get to this later

structs
	classes except really not

MEMORY
I KNOW. I KNOW HOW MEMORY WORKS OK?
Uh. Wait. we're gonna write a memory manager ok great now I actually have to know this
