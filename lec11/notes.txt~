if you make a linked list shit can get real.

struct node {
       int data;
       struct node next;
}

that shit won't compile, incomplete type with an infinite amount of required memory

struct node {
       int data;
       struct node *next;
}

Better, at least we know how big the pointers are. Will compile, still gonna be bad shit though.
