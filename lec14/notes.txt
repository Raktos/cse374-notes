Go there and do whatever really.


COMPILATION
file.c -> preprocessor
  handles preprocessor directives, things with # at the start

preprocessor -> pure C code
  we are now processed and have pure C code

pure C -> compiler
  we are producing an object file, .o file
  (we've been in single file at a time mode for the whole bit now)
  the binary form of the pure C code
  can reference things that are not actually defined yet cause we only done one file

compiler -> .o
  see above

.o -> linker -> executable
  takes undefined linkers in each file and replaces them with the addresses of the stuff in the other files they reference
  we finally got to the many files at once bit.

dependancy goes the other direction

this dependancy can be represented with a Directed Acyclic Graph


MAKEFILES
all that stuff was to set up for makefiles
scripting language, lets us program what to compile when
